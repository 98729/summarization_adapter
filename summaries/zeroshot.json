The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, accepting its jurisdiction over crimes committed since June 13, 2014. This move has been opposed by Israel and the United States, who are not members of the ICC. The ICC has opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, which could lead to war crimes investigations against Israelis. The Palestinians' accession to the ICC is seen as a step toward greater justice and closer to their shared goals of justice and peace.",
